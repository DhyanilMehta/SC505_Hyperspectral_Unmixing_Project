##What is Hyperspectral Unmixing?
The  images  captured  by  the  HSI  camera,  will  give  us  the  image  data  in  the  form  of  a  hyper-cube.  In the hypercube, the pixels may not be a single pixel, it can be a combination of multiple spectra.  Such pixels are known as mixed-pixels or hyper-pixels.  We need to decompose these hyper-pixels into endmember signatures(pure pixel signatures) and corresponding abundances. The process of decomposition of hyper-pixels is known as Hyperspectral Unmixing.
